/**
 * Extensible interface defining the condition groups.
 *
 * Consumers extend it via declaration merging:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * declare module 'build-conditions' {
 *     interface BuildConditionGroups {
 *         platform: 'desktop' | 'mobile';
 *         runtime: 'server' | 'client';
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Condition values must be unique across all groups: a value is resolved
 * to its group (in types, at runtime, and in the SWC plugin) by the value
 * itself, not by a "group → value" pair.
 *
 * The interface is declared right in the entrypoint on purpose: TypeScript
 * module augmentation only merges with an interface declared in the module
 * being augmented and does not work through a re-export. The rest of the
 * package types live in ./types.
